# 🗳️ Electoral Campaign Management System

A complete **full-stack platform for managing electoral campaigns**, where **candidates create and publish their campaign profiles**, and **voters search and explore candidates** through an intuitive web interface.  
The system was designed end-to-end, including **ER modeling**, **use case and sequence diagrams**, **database configuration from scratch**, and full **backend and frontend development**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project was built to **streamline political campaign visibility**, providing a centralized platform for candidates and voters.

The system consists of three core layers:

1. **Frontend Application** — voter- and candidate-facing interface built with React.  
2. **Backend API** — business logic and secure authentication built with NestJS.  
3. **Database Layer** — PostgreSQL database fully modeled and configured from scratch.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🧾 **Candidate Profiles:** Authentication, profile creation, editing, and public campaign pages.  
- 🔍 **Voter Search:** Browse and filter candidates by name, region, or political role.  
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based session management for candidates.  
- 🗂️ **Structured Data Modeling:** Complete ER diagrams, use case diagrams, and sequence diagrams guiding the architecture.  
- 🛢️ **Database From Scratch:** PostgreSQL schema designed and implemented with Prisma ORM.  
- 🌐 **RESTful API:** Clean and modular endpoints Nestjs structure.
